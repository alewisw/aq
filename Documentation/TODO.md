# TODO List
1. Make append() work for both extendable and non-extendable lists.
2. Reimplement walk() so that it becomes readable.
3. Look at test points in walk() to see if we need unit tests for them.
4. Buffer overrun on bad CRC?
5. Corruption resilience - esp. in snapshot
6. Add built-in support for formatting printing into normal and extendable items.
