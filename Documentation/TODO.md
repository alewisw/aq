# TODO List

1. StressTest gets the option to use test points as delay points.
2. Look at test points in walk() to see if we need unit tests for them.
3. Link identifier validation in StressTest
4. Buffer overrun on bad CRC?
5. Corruption resilience - esp. in snapshot
6. StressTest command line arguments.
